<p>Do pleats add weight. This looks makes hair look quite dense and thicker and evens down the facial features in a balanced manner.

These slight brown waves frame the face and extend outwards before moving wildly down inwards towards the chin creating a long and narrow look of your face. Pin On Sexy Hairstyles.</p>
