<p>The classic pixie cut is that asymmetrical and scaled cut very fashionable in this season in which the hair is shorter behind the long sides on the top with a bangs or a tuft. Then you have to close them against the hairs at the nape. I wanted to challenge myself and try using a ponytail extention aka fake ponytail on my super short hair. The latter clip-in wefts are great if you want to wear your hair down but if you fancy pinning it up its trickier once the hair is up the clips become visible and less secure.

<p>Well I finally took the bait and cut my own hair. Simply curl all your hair with an extra-small flat iron for short hair. Use a couple of bobby pins to secure the twist in place. To get this pixie cut keep the top and sides long enough to slick back with some gel or pomade.
