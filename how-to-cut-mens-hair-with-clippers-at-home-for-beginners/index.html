<p>For the ears and sideburns make sure to use a lower grade clipper. Start with a grazing cut at the top of the neckline then cut progressively closer as you. This is my best haircut tutorial yet. If you need to depending on the length of the comb passover the same area to catch any hair that isnt cut to the desired length. Pin On Hair.</p>
