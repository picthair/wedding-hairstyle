<p>Im an ex hairstylist and Im happy to bring you a new tutorial do a mens and boys haircut from home while were all home on quarantine. Cut the back evenly throughout making sure you cut all hairs and the hair clipper missed no hair. For the ears and sideburns make sure to use a lower grade clipper. After opting for one of the many womens clipper cut hairstyles and using the cutter to replicate it on your head the next step involves trimming the hair around your ears sideburns and back of your neck.
