<p>Corgis dachshunds and other short-legged dogs have a duplicated copy of FGF4 a growth regulation gene that causes their legs to develop abnormally. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length having smaller ears and being slightly straighter of leg. Much like the dachshund they are built long and low to the ground. According to the American Kennel Club AKC the preferred coat for Corgis is straight but a little waviness is also permitted.

<p>12 15 years. A corgi has two distinct types of coat on its body. The dwarfism gene became the dominant gene and now expresses itself in todays modern corgi. This breed is known to be a frequent shedder and requies occasional grooming. Pin On Corgies.</p>
