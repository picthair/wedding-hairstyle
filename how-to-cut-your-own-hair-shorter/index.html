<p>This is how a hair dresser cut my hair way back in the 70s when layered hair first came into vogue. Once youve done that you can trim a section at a time by holding the hair between your fingers sliding your fingers down to the desired length and cutting off the remaining hair. A short crew cut takes this practical and trendy haircut to the next level with even shorter hair. The textured buzz cut is slightly similar to the fully patterned buzz cut. Pin On Wig.</p>
