<p>However Im scared to wear my hair up because I dont want it to leave a dented style the next morning in my hair. If your hair is long and you like knotting it make sure it is not too tight as it might pull the hair strands and lead to breakage. Apply minimal product. As my hair gets longer I am finding it harder and harder to wear down to sleep because I wake up with a bunch of knots.
