<p>Even Lord Bieber and One Direction get dolled up for shoots though nothing remotely as radical as G-Dragon or Seventeen. Cultural differencemen wear makeup or what they call bb or cc cream in korea and it is normal there so makeup is not subject to kpop idolshowever not all men there wear it and as a matter of fact some dont like the idea as they see it as gayetc. So however thick and bold they put their makeup on their faces once the lights go over their faces they just disappear.
