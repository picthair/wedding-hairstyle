<p>If youre reading this blog we are guessing you are not a professional- so we recommend playing it safe and cutting your hair dry. One thing to know before you trim Trimming your hair can be time consuming since you are going through each and every curl. Instead by cutting curl by curl I let my individual curls nest together and then examine the shape theyre creating. The only things I can recommend are cutting downward on a slight angle and work with only half the hair at a time. Pin On Natural Hair Locs.</p>

<p>Just cut where it feels right then fluff take a step back and look at it. This technique helps to avoid the dreaded hair-triangle that can easily happen when curly hair is cut straight and blunt. Snip with the ends of the shears rather than with the full length of the blade. After trimming all sections seal the ends with an oil such as argan to mend and help stop any splitting.
