<p>Get in the habit of massaging your head every time youre in the shower. But theres a reason experts suggest trimming your hair every six to eight weeks. Cutting your hair only affects the shaft but not the follicle which is the part responsible for growth and premature loss. So does cutting your hair make it grow faster. Pin On Peinados.</p>

<p>When the scalp is free from oils dirt and sebum hair will grow more healthily. This is generally for healthy hair and is a good enough time to maintain most hairstyles for most hair types. Im thinking about cutting my hair shorter but only if I wont lose the curl I have or if it will make it curlier. Frayed ends make hair look thinner and cause breakage so when you cut them off your hair appears fuller says. Pin On Suburbia Unwrapped.</p>
