<p>The Cloud Nine Micro Wand is perfect for curling short fine hair as it has adjustable heat control and a conical barrel which lets you create different size curls. It allows you to let go of the hair and let it just fall. 2nd curl is from twisting and wrapping. Taking 1 inchish sections I always wrap the hair downard with the wand also pointing down.
