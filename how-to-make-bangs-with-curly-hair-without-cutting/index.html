<p>Start by sectioning off the curls you want to trim in front of your face. Part your hair and start flat twisting that front section on thoroughly detangled hair that is about 60 dry. Decide how much hair you want in front of your face. Cutting just below the brow or longer is optimal. Pin On Beauty Hair Styles Etc Belleza Peinados Etc.</p>

<p>Cutting just below the brow or longer is optimal. HeyIts been a while but Im back with a new video. Starting the bangs too far forward in the front of the hair so that the other hairs fall forward and over the bangs He suggests starting the bangs where the head starts to curve downward. Cutting curly hair in general requires more thought than cutting straight hair. Pin On Curly Bangs.</p>
