<p>My hair was more than halfway down my back and I got it cut in what was supposed to be a short sexy pixie type cut. Sides always seem too short after a haircut This has been something that has always bugged me about getting my hair cut. Once you get all the way over to the side incorporate some of your longer hair into the twist and use bobby pins to hold it all in place. Angle your comb at 45 degrees to choose the starting point of your cut. Pin On Center Part Curtains Hairstyle.</p>
