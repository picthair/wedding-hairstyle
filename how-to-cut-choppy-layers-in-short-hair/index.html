<p>The bob is timeless and is a universal haircut. Start in the top and comb the hair in thin slices approximately ½ to 1-inch running front to back. Shearing involves running the sharp side of scissors down the length of the hair andor turning the scissors vertically and cutting upward in millimeter-sized pieces slowly chipping away at the ends of the layers. Keep the hair moistened and run your fingers through the sections as you complete them to check the level of texture created.

<p>Heres what to know before your next salon appointment. Razor cut this section as you did with the front portion of your hair. Avoid choppy layers by pulling the hair out so it is perpendicular to your head before cutting it. Pick up a section of hair at the back and bring it around to the side of your ear so you can see it in the mirror. Pin On Bob Hairstyles.</p>
