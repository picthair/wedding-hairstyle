<p>I thought it was because I have very thick hair so I tried to thin it a bit myself. Its easy enough to reason why. Reasons for this can be a result of a number of things from relaxer over processing to medicines Ive taken or am taking. Split ends can be caused by overuse of hot styling tools and chemical processing or just brushing your hair incorrectly.
