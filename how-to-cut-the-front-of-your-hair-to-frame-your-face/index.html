<p>Cut your hair below you fingers with a pair of hairdressing shears. To cut short face framing layers begin with damp combed hair. Continue snipping loops from the bottom until the curl is the length that you want it. Use your comb to direct the hair across your face at a low 45 degree angle. Pin On Big Southern Hair.</p>

<p>One reason for this is making sure youre getting a haircut that complements your face shape. Use your comb to direct the hair across your face at a low 45 degree angle. Cut the fanned portion of the twisted hair making sure the scissors are pointed up and at a 45-degree angle when trimming the fanned area. Use four more elastic bands to tie each section at the point where you want to cut your hair. Pin On Getting Older.</p>
